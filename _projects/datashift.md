Datashift was created to help teams and individuals manage the incoming data that they deal with on a day-to-day basis.  Primary features:

- Automatic connection to online services such as Dropbox allow for seamless data intergration.
- Intuitive graphic creation features that are straightforward to use but create powerful visuals.
- Real-time updates to your data automatically sync to your datashift projects and graphics.

Datashift has been a very fun project.  Development is ongoing and there are big plans for the future!
