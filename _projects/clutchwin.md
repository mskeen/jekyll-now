Clutch Win Stats was created with the intention of making the enormous amount of data on the [Retrosheet](http://www.retrosheet.org/ "Retrosheet.org") site available to everyone.  Retrosheet's data is free for anyone to use, but the file formats and the scale of the data make it quite an undertaking to set up an environment in which queries can be executed.

Clutch Win Stats starts with a full database of the Retrosheet data and adds an interface for writing scripts and running queries.  It has a bit of a learning curve, but the effort is rewarded by the ability to execute complex data inquiries in a few lines of code.

The site also features a well-documented API that can be used by mobile applications or other web sites.

Clutch Win Stats is still in active development.
