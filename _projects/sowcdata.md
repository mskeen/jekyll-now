The SOWCData site was built as part of a contract that I completed for the University of Waterloo.  UW had partnered with IBM and the Southern Ontario Water Consortium on the project.  There were some interesting UI elements with the project dashboards that are generated in the application, and a complete API was added in order to make the SOWC data available to authorized third parties.
