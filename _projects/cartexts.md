CarTexts is a text lead-generating tool targeted at people who are selling cars. The core of the system is a message-processing module that kicks into action whenever someone sends a text to the listed number. It responds with the details for the requested listing and sends an email to the person responsible for the car.

It was an interesting project in terms of interfacing with the API for a 3rd-party SMS provider, and it's been running smoothly for years with almost no downtime.
