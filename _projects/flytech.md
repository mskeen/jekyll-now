Flytech was created to help alleviate the reliance on paperwork that currently hinders the efficiency of administration in flight clubs and flight schools.  It features the following:

- A unique calculator that uses factors such as weather conditions, customer flight history, and the flight plan to determine which flights and auto-approved and which require escalation for approval.
- A dashboard that allows the flight dispatcher to quickly identify the status of all flights.  Overdue flights are highlighted, and eventually alerts are sent if required.
- A sign-up/registration module that includes dynamic document creation and ensures that new customers have reviewed and accepted the required information.
- Customizable settings for all aspects of the flight club's requirements and processes.
