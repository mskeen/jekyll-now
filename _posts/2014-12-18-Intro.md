Thanks for visiting my site.  I finally ditched my old Wordpress site and I'm trying out Jekyll instead.  Seems great so far!

There's not much here yet, but I'll be adding more projects and blog entries in the near future.  If you have any comments or suggestions, please feel free to [contact me](/contact "Contact Me").

### Background Photo

The background photo was taken in February of 2014 from the window of my home office. It's a very peaceful and productive setting for me, so I strongly prefer to work remotely when the option is available.
