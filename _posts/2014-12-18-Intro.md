Thanks for visiting my site.  I finally ditched my old Wordpress site and I'm trying out Jekyll instead.  Seems great so far!

There's not much here yet, but I'll be adding more projects and blog entries in the near future.  If you have any comments or suggestions, please feel free to [contact me](/contact "Contact Me").

### My Office Setup

Most of the work I do is from my home office. I work on an iMac with dual 27" displays, and I use a MacBook Air when I need to be mobile.  For servers, Ubuntu is my OS of choice.

Below is the view from my home office (taken last winter):
