I'm a software developer with nearly 20 years of experience. I specialize in web development with Ruby on Rails, which I've been using since version 1.0 in 2006.

After starting my career with over a decade in the corporate world, I spent five years working for a couple of early-stage startups.  In 2011, I gave up my full-time position in order to persue my dream of running my own business.

Currently, my main interest is building revenue-generating sites focused on data analysis and data visualization.

### Availability

If you have an interesting project, I'm available for freelance work. [Contact me](/contact "Contact Me") with details and we'll see if we can work something out.
