<h1>About Mike Skeen</h1>
<p>
  I’m a software developer with nearly 20 years of experience. I specialize in
  web development with Ruby on Rails, which I’ve been using since version 1.0
  in 2006.
</p>

<p>
  After starting my career with over a decade in the corporate world, I spent
  five years working for a couple of early-stage startups.  In 2011, I gave up
  my full-time position in order to persue my dream of running my own business.
</p>

<p>
  Currently, my main interest is building revenue-generating sites focused on
  data analysis and data visualization.
