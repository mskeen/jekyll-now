<h1>About Mike Skeen</h1>
<p>
  I’m a software developer with nearly 20 years of experience. I specialize in
  web development with Ruby on Rails, which I’ve been using since version 1.0
  in 2006.
</p>

<p>
  After starting my career with over a decade in the corporate world, I spent
  five years working for a couple of early-stage startups.  In 2011, I gave up
  my full-time position in order to pursue my dream of running my own business.
</p>

<p>
  Currently, my main interest is building sites focused on
  data analysis and data visualization.

<h3 id="background-photo">Background Photo</h3>

<p>
  The background photo for this site was taken in February of 2014 from the
  window of my home office. It's a very peaceful and productive setting for me,
  so I strongly prefer to work remotely when the option is available.
